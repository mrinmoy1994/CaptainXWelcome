      <div *ngIf="block[43]" class="Answer">
          Once you withdraw from your wallet it generally takes 3-5 working days for the amount to be credited in your account. In any case if the amount will not be credited we suggest you please check the banking details you have updated in Captain X. If the credentials are correct and you still do not get the amount in your account kindly write to us with documentary evidence. We will take the necessary actions at the earliest and try to resolve your issues.
