    <h1>LEGALITY</h1>
 
    <h2>Game of Mere Skills:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>“Playing fantasy games online requires considerable skill, judgement and discretion, the Punjab and Haryana High court has held and observed that such games can’t be considered gambling.”</strong> – TOI April 08, 2018 
The court also had mentioned that Fantasy Sports is not a Game of Chance. Rather it is a “GAME OF SKILLS”, which is a business activity with due registration which pays service tax and income tax and Fantasy sports is protected by Article 19 (1) (g) of the Indian Constitution. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has also declared fantasy games a legitimate business activity which requires knowledge and skills.

      <p>
        According to the “Public Gambling Act – 1867 (PGA)”, this act will not apply to games of mere skill. Fantasy sports is not dominated by ‘chance’ but determined by ‘skill’. People have to use their knowledge and capacity of strategic ability instead of luck to play and win the game. Thus, we can say this is ‘Game of Skill’ and free from any type of Gambling.
